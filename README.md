# Lost Bytes

A lightweight, opinionated **Astro** blog / public notebook where I publish notes, experiments, and fragments I didn’t want to lose.

This repo is based on the AstroPaper theme, slimmed down to keep only the essentials:
- Markdown posts (Content Collections)
- Tags
- RSS + sitemap
- Light/Dark mode
- Clean layout & basic SEO

Disabled on purpose:
- Search (Pagefind)
- Archives
- Scheduled-post hiding
- Dynamic OG image generation

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
