Lost Bytes is a public notebook.

It's a place to keep things I've learned, tested, or clarified — and didn't want to lose.

Some notes are about language and teaching, others about software, AI, writing, or tools.

The topics may change. The structure stays simple.

If something here is useful to others, even better.
