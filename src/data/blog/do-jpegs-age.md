I've carried this idea around for years: that JPEG images slowly degrade just by existing.

That if you save a photo, leave it untouched long enough, and come back years later, it will somehow be worse.

Turns out that's not how it works.

## Short answer

👉 JPEG files do **not** age, rot, or lose quality over time.  
A JPEG saved in 1998 and stored safely will be bit-for-bit identical today.

If something changes, it's not time doing the damage.

## What JPEGs do *not* do ❌

- ❌ They do not slowly deteriorate
- ❌ They do not lose quality just by sitting on disk
- ❌ They do not "fade" like VHS tapes or printed photos
- ❌ They do not change if left completely untouched

Digital files are static.  
Either the bits are intact — or they're corrupted.

There's no in-between.

## Where the confusion comes from ✅

### 1. Repeated re-saving (generation loss)

This is the real culprit.

JPEG is a **lossy** compression format.  
Every time you:

- open a JPEG
- edit it
- save it again as JPEG

👉 compression is applied again, and more information is discarded.

Do this enough times, and the degradation becomes visible.

This is often remembered as *"JPEGs aging"*, but it's really **human workflows causing loss**, not time.

### 2. Storage corruption (rare, format-agnostic)

All digital files — JPEG, PNG, PDF, ZIP — can suffer from:

- failing hard drives
- bad SSD cells
- faulty controllers
- cosmic ray bit flips (yes, really)

But when this happens:

- it's not gradual
- it's not aesthetic
- the file usually becomes partially unreadable or broken

And it's not JPEG-specific.

### 3. Platform re-exports

Social media platforms, messengers, and CMSs often:

- recompress images
- downscale resolution
- strip metadata

Each upload → download → re-upload cycle introduces **new compression artifacts**, reinforcing the idea that the image is "getting worse over time".

Again, it's workflow — not age.

## The important distinction 🧠

| Concept | Real? | Time-based? |
|------|------|-----------|
| JPEG aging | ❌ Myth | ❌ No |
| Repeated recompression | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Storage corruption | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Rare |
| Physical photo decay | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Best practices (especially for archiving)

If you want zero degradation:

- keep an original master (RAW, TIFF, PNG)
- never overwrite it
- export JPEGs only as derivatives

If you must edit JPEGs:

- edit → save once
- avoid multiple save cycles
- use the highest quality setting

For long-term archives:

- use redundant backups (3-2-1 rule)
- verify checksums periodically (for serious collections)

## Why this myth stuck around

In the late 90s and early 2000s:

- JPEGs were edited repeatedly
- storage was unreliable
- originals were often lost

People compared *old* JPEGs to a memory of what they once were — and blamed time.

## Bottom line

JPEGs don't age.

People re-saving them do.

So then I just remembered it wrong.
